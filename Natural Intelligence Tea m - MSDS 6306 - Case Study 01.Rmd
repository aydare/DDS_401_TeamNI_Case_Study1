 ---taken data Brewery data and combined it with our Beer data based on the Unique Beer ID to allow for a deeper analysis. 

```{r Combine Beer and Brewery data}

colnames(BeersAndBreweries) <- c("Beer_ID", "Beer_Name", "ABV", "IBU", "Brewery_id", "Style", "Ounces", "Brewery_Name", "City", "State")
